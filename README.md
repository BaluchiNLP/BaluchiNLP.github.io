#### Neural Machine Translation
Transformer-based NMT model for Baluchi to English and back translation.
#### Data Collection
  Need parallel text data in both Baluchi and English. This can include news articles, books, websites, or any other source with aligned sentences in both languages.
#### Data Preprocessing:
  Cleaning the text, removing noise and irrelevant characters, tokenizing words, and converting everything to lowercase. Might also need to handle specific challenges like diacritics and named entities in Baluchi text.
