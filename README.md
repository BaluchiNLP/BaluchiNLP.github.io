#### Neural Machine Translation
Transformer-based NMT model for Baluchi to English and back translation.
#### Data Collection
  Need parallel text data in both Baluchi and English. This can include news articles, books, websites, or any other source with aligned sentences in both languages.
#### Data Preprocessing:
  Cleaning the text, removing noise and irrelevant characters, tokenizing words, and converting everything to lowercase. Might also need to handle specific challenges like diacritics and named entities in Baluchi text.

#### Framework and Model:
- Opensource NMT include:
  - [Marian NMT](https://marian-nmt.github.io/)
  - [FairSeq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq) includes pretrained models for Neural Machine Translation and Neural Language Modeling.

  - [OpenNMT](https://github.com/OpenNMT)
 
- Transformer model:
  There are various Transformer architectures like:
  - [The base Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index)
  - [Transformer-XL](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/transfo-xl)
  - [T5](https://paperswithcode.com/method/t5)
