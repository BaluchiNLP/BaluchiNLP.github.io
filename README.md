#### Neural Machine Translation
Transformer-based NMT model for Baluchi to English and back translation.
#### Data Collection
  Need parallel text data in both Baluchi and English. This can include news articles, books, websites, or any other source with aligned sentences in both languages.
#### Data Preprocessing:
  Cleaning the text, removing noise and irrelevant characters, tokenizing words, and converting everything to lowercase. Might also need to handle specific challenges like diacritics and named entities in Baluchi text.

#### Framework and Model:
- Opensource NMT include:
  - [Marian NMT](https://marian-nmt.github.io/)
  - [FairSeq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq) includes pretrained models for Neural Machine Translation and Neural Language Modeling.

  - [OpenNMT](https://github.com/OpenNMT)
 
- Transformer model:
  There are various Transformer architectures like:
  - [The base Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index)
  - [Transformer-XL](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/transfo-xl)
  - [T5](https://paperswithcode.com/method/t5)
 
#### Training the Model:
##### Fine-tune the pre-trained model: 
Most frameworks provide pre-trained Transformer models on large datasets like English-French or English-German. Fine-tune these models on Baluchi-English dataset to adapt them to specific translation task.
##### Hyperparameter tuning: 
Experiment with different hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and optimizer to optimize model's performance. 
##### Monitor training: 
Metrics like BLEU score, ROUGE score, and translation quality to assess model's progress.

####  Evaluation and Refinement:
Test model on a held-out set of Baluchi-English sentences that it hasn't seen during training. This will give a more realistic picture of its generalizability.
Identify common errors made by model and try to understand the reasons behind them. Use this information to refine training data, model architecture, or hyperparameters.
