#### Neural Machine Translation
Transformer-based NMT model for Baluchi to English and back translation.
##### Data Collection and Preprocessing:
  Need parallel text data in both Baluchi and English. This can include news articles, books, websites, or any other source with aligned sentences in both languages.
##### Data Preprocessing:
  Cleaning the text, removing noise and irrelevant characters, tokenizing words, and converting everything to lowercase. Might also need to handle specific challenges like diacritics and named entities in Baluchi text.

#### Framework and Model:
Opensource NMT include Marian NMT [Marian NMT](https://marian-nmt.github.io/), FairSeq ([FairSeq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq)), OpenNMT ([OpenNMT](https://github.com/OpenNMT)), and the Transformers library ([Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index)).
